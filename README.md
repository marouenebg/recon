The recon.sh script contain the process of reconnaissance on a domain.

during this process i used multiple tools such as Sublist3r,httprobe and eyewitness.

here is the links for these project so that you can run the script.

httprobe: https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe 
Sublist3r: https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r
Eyewitness: https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness
to note that eyewitness could be installed directly in linux using " sudo apt-get install eyewitness"
 ---------------------
A subdomains script has been added to the directory, so now we could sudomains using crt.sh certspotter and a lot of other tools.
more subdomains means more information on the domain, COOL!!
